# Universum-Sim
>This is the final course project of an advanced Python class.
>It is an extremly simplified simulation of planetary bodies' movement

## Setup
To run this project install numpy and pygame (For Ubuntu/Debian):
```
$ sudo apt-get install python3-numpy
$ sudo apt-get install python3-pygame
```
Then to start simply run the ```main.py``` module:
```
$ python3 main.py
```

## Features
Simulating the movement of multiple planetary bodies
* Place planetary bodies in main menu via left mouse click, remove with right mouse
* See the attributes of the planetary bodies by left clicking on them
* Press start to simulate their movement (Maximum of 10 bodies, works best around 3)
* Navigate the menu with the arrow keys and esc
